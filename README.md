# Task-Manager-System
Software Engineering Project designed for project managers allows users to manage projects and tasks of this project.
With this application, users can create new projects and assign tasks or developers to them. If a developer was assigned to
a certain project, they can not work on other projects, they can do tasks only in the assigned project. Task Manager System was 
written in c# with using external libraries for validating data and managing dependency injection. Also this project has logical 
and understandable architecture where business logic, user interface and data models are divided into different folders.
